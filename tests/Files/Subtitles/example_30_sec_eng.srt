00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the Flying Spaghetti Monster said: Let there be light. And there was light.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He adjusted His noodly eyestalks and saw that the light was good.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And it was good; and the Flying Spaghetti Monster separated the light from the darkness.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night — or “Prime Time.”

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And there was evening, and there was morning: the first day.
